Home Automation Projects

Draft

Trying to figure out how to port my website https://sites.google.com/site/cartwrightraspberrypiprojects/home from Google Sites to github
* I can either try to make my Google Sites website as responsive as it allows, or
* I can migrate the site to github pages

I forked uikit to here. This was wrong thing to do. Best to just use raw github source from uikit.

I'd like to use uikit as the css.

Open a browser and enter: https://dumbo25.github.io/

# Github Pages Setup
* Create github account, or use the one you have
* Download [http://mac.github.com/](GitHub for Mac)
*
